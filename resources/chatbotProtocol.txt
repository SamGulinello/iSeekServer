SYNTAX
The "%" special character would never be included in a word coming back from chatbot. The number specifies
how many times the app will have to interact with the server. Example would be looking for a specific item.
The first interaction would include listening for the chatbot response then sending an image. The second
interaction would be listening for a boolen value indicating if the item was included in the image. The last 
two characters of codes is a short version of the method. Example: Take picture -> tp. All the codes are a 
fixed length.
